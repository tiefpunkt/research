## OpenDesk
Most famous example of open source furniture. Repository/collection of different designs, with options to get them made as well. Not all designs are free.

## Social Furniture
Kitchen- & community-space-focused furniture built from yellow wood sheeting. License unclear.

### Related work
This was done earlier, but not sure when it was released. Also called "Social Furniture", and also uses those yellow boards: <http://www.ufg.ac.at/Social-Furniture.11740.0.html> There are no instructions or design files, unfortunately.

### 3D printing
3D printing entire pieces of furniture is usually not very practical. However, a usage for 3D printing in open source furniture seem to be connectors, allowing to connect e.g. pieces of wood together to a certain design.
