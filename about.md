When starting a project, or even just toying with an idea, I like to digg through blogs and other parts of the internet to gather all kinds of information, ideas, and related projects. It usually starts with tens and hundreds of browser tabs, and then ends with a large collection of links in Evernote, where it'll be eventually forgotten.

This is an experiment to get this research in a more usable form, for me, but more important everyone else who might be interested.
